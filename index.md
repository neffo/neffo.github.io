This is a placeholder for the moment.

If you use Gnome and like a new wallpaper every day, please check out my [BingWallpaper](https://github.com/neffo/bing-wallpaper-gnome-extension) extension. It's not on extensions.gnome.org yet, but you can install from the [zip file](https://neffo.github.io/BingWallpaper@ineffable-gmail.com.zip). Please let me know if it breaks for you, if you have any feature requests, or make modifications yourself.

This extension is based extensively on the NASA APOD extension by Elinvention (see https://github.com/Elinvention) and inspired by Bing Desktop Wallpaper Changer by Utkarsh Gupta (see https://github.com/UtkarshGpta). Please check out their work too.
