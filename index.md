I'm an avid Ubuntu and GNOME user, and in my spare time I've created a few GNOME extensions to add a splash of colour or utility to the experience.

## Bing Wallpaper

My [Bing Wallpaper](https://github.com/neffo/bing-wallpaper-gnome-extension) extension was my first attempt at creating an extension and has been quite successful, I think. This extension was based on the NASA APOD extension by Elinvention and inspired by both the original Windows app and the Bing Desktop Wallpaper Changer by Utkarsh Gupta.

## Google Earth View

This extension uses the curated Google Earth images to create a dynamic wallpaper [experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1iQ-6KDQ2w).
